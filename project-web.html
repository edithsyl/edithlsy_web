          Some might say having a portfolio website is a must for aspiring
          programmers and desginers... However, I found the portfolio website
          templates avaliable online a bit boring and don't fit my personality
          well. Therefore, I decided to design and develop one for my own.
        </p>
        <section id="problemStatement">
          <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
          <p>
            Nowadays, almost everyone has a portfolio website. I need one to
            showcase my skills and past projects to increase my chance of
            getting a nice job.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="planning">
          <h1>Planning</h1>
          <p>
            Any UXUI couse would teach you the first step is to research and
            plan. And according to Google Foundation of User Experience:
          </p>
          <p class="blue">
            In the field of user experience design, the ‚Äúuser‚Äù comes first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well said Google, well said. (please hire me someday?) <br />
            So I try to come up with two personas that are gonna visit my
            website
          </p>
          <div class="persona">
            <div class="persona__title">
              <img src="/app/assets/decor/guy persona.png" alt="persona1" />
              <h2>Persona 1: The Recruiter</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              Possibly a middle age guy, who is smart, handsome and likes to get
              things done efficiently.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="persona">
            <div class="persona__title">
              <div class="persona-m-img"></div>
              <!-- <img src="/app/assets/decor/fem persona.png" alt="persona" /> -->
              <h2>Persona 2: The Client</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              Someone youthful and green, looking for peers to collaborate with.
              She is open-minded, self-driven and have a vision or project in
              mind.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="blue">
            Need: Figure out my abilities and determine if I would be good at my
            job with the shortest time possible
          </p>
          <p class="pink">
            Summary: <br />
            - make my website easier to comprehend, so people could find key
            information quickly <br />
            - to better showcase my skills, I should put more effort in
            explaining my past projects and what I have learned through the
            process
          </p>
          <h2>What about me?</h2>
          <p>
            I want my website to be in line with my personalities. So I did a
            little soul-searching research about myself:
          </p>
          <p>
            I would describe myself as creative, with quirky humour, passionate
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope my website could be homely and warm, like a scribbled
            notebook. But it should be clean and easy to read all the same.
          </p>

        <section id="design">
          <h1>Design</h1>
          <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <h2>Font</h2>
          <p>
            I decided to go with Josefin Sans and Lusitana. Josefin Sans is
            great for large texts and has a vintage feeling, while Lusitana
            looks like fonts that are used in books.

          <h1>Success?</h1>
          <p>
            I have set three sucess metrics for myself at the beginning of this
            project:
          </p>
          <h2>1. Good Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            Well I guess by this point, I made a pretty neat documentation. At
            least this is the first time I design so mindfully and record every
            idea and attempt I have in such a maticulous way.
          </p>
          <h2>2. Completion Rate</h2>
          <p>
            Did I stick with this project from start to finish? Guess I did :)
